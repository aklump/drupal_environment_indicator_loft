![Environment Indicator Loft](../../images/screenshot.png)

## Summary

This is an alternative UX by [In the Loft Studios](http://intheloftstudios.com) for the well known Drupal module [Environment Indicator](https://www.drupal.org/project/environment_indicator).

## Features

* Removes the color from the admin toolbar, and wraps the entire screen in a faint edge glow.
* Adds an informative label in the corner of the window.
* Provides the GIT branch in the description.
* Allows hiding the indicator by clicking or double clicking the label.
* Is highly customizable at the code-level.

See [installing](@installing) and [configuring](@configuring) to get started.

## Requirements

1. [Environment Indicator Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/environment_indicator)

## Usage

The border can get in the way when doing front-end developing therefor it can be hidden easily. Single clicking it will hide it until the next request, and double clicking will hide it for all new requests for a length of time.
